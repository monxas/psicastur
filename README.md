- [Git](https://git-scm.com/)
- A text editor (e.g., [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/))

## Usage

### Local Development

To serve the website locally, run:

\`\`\`bash
hugo server
\`\`\`

By default, the website will be available at \`http://localhost:1313/\`. Changes will automatically reload in the browser.

### Build

To generate the static files for deployment, run:

\`\`\`bash
hugo
\`\`\`

The generated files will be placed in the \`public/\` directory.

## Configuration

- Update site settings in \`config.toml\`, \`config.yaml\`, or \`config.json\`, depending on your preferred configuration format.
- Customize the theme by editing the files in the \`themes/\` directory.

## Deployment

To deploy the static files, you can use various services like:

- [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/)
- [Vercel](https://vercel.com/)
- [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/)

For example, to deploy on Netlify:

1. Create a new site on Netlify.
2. Link your repository.
3. Set the build command to \`hugo\`.
4. Set the publish directory to \`public\`.

Alternatively, run the following command to build and deploy manually:
